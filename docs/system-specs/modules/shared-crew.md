# Shared Crew

Owners: `kiro_crew.shared_crew` (contracts in `contracts`, `admission`, `collab`, the
record codec in `codec`) and the browser mirror `website/src/api/sharedCrew.ts`.
Behaviour modules for each area below live beside the contracts in the same package
and import them; none redefines a field.

## 1. Purpose and boundaries

Shared Crew lets several people who can already reach one Crew work in it together.
It attributes what each person does, charges execution to the person who asked for
it, keeps one person from exhausting the host, and shows collaborators to each other.

It is an attribution and fairness layer, not an access layer. The network (Tailscale)
and the existing dashboard auth in `dashboard.token_auth` decide who may connect;
Shared Crew never admits a request auth refused, and never refuses one auth admitted
because an identity lookup failed. Every authorized collaborator has the same
application rights. There are no roles, no per-session ACLs, no invitations and no
in-Crew member management.

Status: the contract types, codec, state machine and their tests are in the tree. The
behaviour each later section describes (derivation, stores, scheduler, routes, frames)
is the contract those modules implement; a section names its module once that module
exists. Until then the gateway behaves as a single-operator Crew and `Capabilities`
reports every Shared Crew capability unavailable.

## 2. Identity

### Principal

`contracts.Principal` is the identity work and records are attributed to. Its `id`
is `principal_id_for(provider, issuer, subject)`: a deterministic, opaque digest, so
one person maps to one id on every device and tab without a registry, and the id does
not reveal the login. Email and display name are never inputs; two providers asserting
the same email are two principals. `DisplaySnapshot` is a label captured when the
principal was seen. A rename changes it and leaves `id` alone. It carries no avatar
URL, because a remote URL in a shared record is an outbound fetch someone else chose.

`PrincipalKind` separates a person (`human`), a device with no personal identity
(`machine`, such as an ACL-tagged tailnet node, keyed by node because every tagged
node reports the same login), Crew automation (`system`, one bounded principal per
named component from `Principal.system`), and `unknown`.

### Derivation

`identity.publish_actor` derives the principal once per request, after
`token_auth_middleware` admitted it and before the handler, and publishes an
`ActorContext` under `request[ACTOR_REQUEST_KEY]`. Handlers read it with
`identity.actor_of` (`viewer_principal` for the principal); a request with no
published actor reads as Unknown, never as the operator. The WebSocket upgrade
passes through the same middleware, so a socket's actor is the upgrade request's.
The browser never names itself: a principal is never read from a body, query,
header or display name, and `from_dict` exists only to read records this server
wrote.

Evidence, strongest first (`identity.derive_principal`):

| Request | Principal | Provenance |
|---|---|---|
| An app identity (an app token, or an internal caller the middleware derived an app for) | `system`, component `app:<name>` | `internal` |
| The internal loopback secret (kiro-cli, MCP, doctor) | `system`, component `internal` | `internal` |
| Loopback peer forwarded by local `tailscale serve`, resolved and allowlisted by `tailnet.resolve_forwarded_peer` | `human` keyed by tailnet login; `machine` keyed by node for a tagged node | `tailscale_serve` |
| Tailnet peer connecting to the gateway's tailnet address directly, no forwarding header, resolved by daemon `whois` of the socket address (`tailnet.resolve_direct_peer`) | as above | `tailscale_direct` |
| Loopback socket with no forwarding header at all | `human`, the local operator, keyed by the token subject | `local_operator` |
| Anything else auth admitted | `Principal.unknown()` | `none` |

A tailnet principal's subject is the lowercased daemon login under provider
`tailscale` and issuer `tailnet`; a tagged node's is `node:<name>`, because every
tagged node reports the login `tagged-devices`. The display snapshot is the login
(or node name) as the daemon reported it, so a rename never changes the id.

Supported topologies: exactly the two tailnet rows, and both require the existing
identity-trust opt-in (`dashboard.tailscale.trust_identity` with a non-empty
`allowed_logins`, i.e. `TailnetTrust.enforces_identity`). Without it no daemon
lookup runs and tailnet callers are Unknown. The serve row reuses the
middleware's existing resolution, allowlist deny and pin unchanged. The direct
row is attribution only: its lookup runs after the auth decision, shares the
whois cache and executor, and is read by neither the pin (a direct peer stays
`ip:`-pinned) nor the allowlist, so it cannot admit or refuse a request.

Loopback alone is not proof of a trusted proxy: a loopback request carrying any
forwarding header (`origin.is_proxied_request`) is never the local operator, and
its forwarded address is attributed only through the daemon. A
`Tailscale-User-Login` header that disagrees with the daemon drops the
attribution. A non-loopback peer that sends `X-Forwarded-For` is a proxy on
another node and is Unknown. Funnel, other reverse proxies and unverifiable
forwarding headers resolve to Unknown.

Failure never changes access. Derivation runs only on an admitted request, and
an exception anywhere in it publishes Unknown. A request auth refused publishes
nothing.

`ActorContext.auth` is a copy of what the middleware decided, kept for audit. It is
not a second decision. `correlation_id` is the client's `X-Correlation-Id` when it
is a short plain token, else the server's `request_id`.

### Observed collaborators

`people` keeps a bounded in-memory record (`MAX_OBSERVED` principals, LRU) of the
human and machine principals seen on authorized requests, with first and last
sighting and a device count (a digest per node, at most `MAX_DEVICES`). Unknown
and system principals are not recorded. `GET /api/shared-crew/people` merges that
with the creators recorded on persisted sessions. Each row names its `sources`
(`observed`, `session_creator`), so an observation is never presented as
membership; `directory.state` is `unavailable` because this build has no
authoritative assigned-user directory. Per-person `usage` is `null`, and
`usage_available` false, until the admission layer registers a reader
(`people.register_usage_source`).

## 3. Session attribution and records

`SessionAttribution` is stored under the metadata-line key
`SESSION_ATTRIBUTION_META_KEY` (`attribution`). It is not `created_by`, which already
names the creating slot key. It is write-once: `keep_creator` returns the stored value
whenever one exists, so a later message by someone else never changes the creator.

The slot holds it on `_attribution` (`attribution.slot_attribution`).
`attribution.stamp_creator` records the creating actor where a session is
created; `stamp_creator_if_fresh` records the sender of the first accepted user
message of a slot no creation path stamped, and only when the slot holds no user
turn yet. The metadata codec's `attribution` row writes it on both save forms and
reads it back on every hydration purpose. No writer lists the key as owned, so a
save that does not write it carries the stored value through
`history.carry_unowned_metadata`, and the whole line is replaced atomically by the
existing full save.

A session with no `attribution` key reads as `legacy_missing` with an Unknown creator.
It stays legacy: the codec never writes a legacy value back, no stamp replaces it,
and nothing back-fills it, least of all from the current viewer. Attribution was on
but no principal could be established reads as `unattributed`. A damaged attribution
object, or a torn metadata line, reads as legacy, because authorization never reads
it and a damaged record may only lose its label. Keys inside the attribution object
this build does not know are kept (`extra`) and written back.

The metadata line is a file an agent's own tools can write, like `created_by`.
The creator is therefore a label for discovery, never an input to an access
decision.

Browser-bound copies use `attribution.public_attribution`: availability, creation
time and `Principal.to_public_dict` (id, kind, display; no issuer or subject).
The slot payload (`slot_projection`) and every session catalog row
(`history_search.SessionCatalogProjection.list_sessions`) carry it as
`attribution`.

A message's author rides in the message `meta` under `MESSAGE_AUTHOR_META_KEY`
(`author`), in the public principal shape, stamped by the server when it accepts
the message (`attribution.stamp_message_author`). A client-supplied `author` key is
discarded at ingress and overwritten at the stamp. A message written before
authors reads as Unknown (`attribution.message_author`).

### Session list query

`session_query.query_sessions` runs over the whole persisted catalog: machine
transcripts are dropped, then the search (`q`, case-insensitive over title and
key) and the creator filter, then the page is cut. Order is newest `modified`
first with a key digest as the tiebreak. The cursor is a keyset position, so one
walk never returns a row twice; a session modified during a walk moves to the top
and appears on the next walk. `total_matching` counts every session passing the
search and the filter. `hidden_by_filter` counts the sessions passing the search
that the creator filter excluded. The list covers persisted sessions; a slot
that has never been saved is not in it. The route answers only the dashboard
user, and refuses an app token or an internal caller with 403, so it reaches no
session the existing list does not.

### Audit

`ActionRecord` audits a consequential shared action: session create, message,
approval, question answer, steer, cancel, retry and control actions. It names the
initiator, the responder where one exists, the runtime reference, the outcome and a
causal link. It carries ids, never prompt text or credentials.

`audit.record_action` writes it to the existing tamper-evident security event log
(`kiro_crew.sel`) as one `shared_crew_action` event: `caller_identity` is the
initiator's principal id, `operation` is `shared_crew.<action_type>`, `resources`
is the target, `request_id` the correlation id, and `metadata` holds the action
ids and a reduced principal (id, kind, provenance, login). That log's HMAC chain,
size rotation and age retention bound it; there is no second audit store.

The write is the log's fail-closed `critical` mode, off the event loop, bounded by
`AUDIT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`. `record_action` returns whether the record is confirmed.
When it is not, the action still applies and its response says it was not
audited (`audited: false`). A refused audit must not wedge a turn, and it must not
be reported as recorded. An action whose own durable row already names its actor
(a message row carries its author) is audited with `schedule_action_audit`,
which does not make the caller wait and makes no audit claim in the response; a
failed write is logged.

## 4. Admission and accepted work

### Operation state machine

`admission.TRANSITIONS` is the one state machine every entry point reports through,
and `website/src/api/sharedCrew.ts` `OPERATION_TRANSITIONS` mirrors it
(`test_typescript_transition_table_matches_python` pins the two equal).

```
submitted -> queued | admitted | rejected
queued -> admitted | cancelled | expired | reconciling
admitted -> running | queued | cancelled | expired | reconciling | failed
running -> cancelling | completed | failed | reconciling
cancelling -> cancelled | completed | failed | reconciling
reconciling -> queued | running | completed | failed | cancelled | unknown_outcome
```

`submitted` exists only in the client. `rejected` is reachable only from it, and
`AcceptedWork` refuses both: a rejected request was never accepted. `admitted ->
queued` is a start-time revalidation that found capacity gone; `admitted ->
cancelled` is one that found the grant or policy revoked, so a queue record is never
standing permission. `reconciling -> queued` requires proof the work never started.
Ambiguous execution after a crash ends in `unknown_outcome` and is surfaced, never
replayed.

`TASKQ_STATE_MAP` maps every `kiro_crew.taskq.model` state onto this machine; the
durable queue stays the store of record and this is its projection.

### Capacity accounting

Work counts against active capacity in `CAPACITY_HOLDING` and against queue depth in
`QUEUE_HOLDING`. `AcceptedWork.release_allowed` returns capacity only for terminal
work whose `RuntimeOwnershipRef` shows the runtime and every descendant proven stopped.
Restart, disconnect or lease expiry therefore never frees a slot while a child lives.

`RuntimeOwnershipRef` points into the existing ownership registry
(`runtime_ownership` lease, `RuntimeTenancy` epoch, taskq generation, systemd scope
unit). It is not a second registry. Its `liveness` is what the reconciler proved,
never what a client reported.

### Requests and idempotency

`AdmissionRequest.budget_key` is the initiator's principal id. It is never the session
creator and never a per-device token, so tabs, devices, reconnects and child tasks of
one person share one budget. Work in a shared session is charged to whoever started
it.

The client sends an `Idempotency-Key` header per logical send and reuses it on retry.
The deduplication scope is `idempotency_scope(budget_key, session_key, key)`, retained
for `IDEMPOTENCY_TTL_SECONDS`. A replay with the same `request_digest` returns the
existing `AcceptedWork`; a different digest is `idempotency_conflict`. A retry never
runs a prompt twice.

### Responses

A refusal or conflict answers `admission.error_body`: the dashboard's
`{"error", "code"}` envelope, plus `capacity` on a limit and `current` (the public
`AcceptedWork`) on a conflict, so a stale UI action reconciles against server truth.
The status comes from `REASON_HTTP_STATUS`, and a refusal with a retry hint sends
`Retry-After` (`retry_after_header`). `CapacityResponse` reports both scopes' limits
and usage and the effective `EnforcementLevel`. It has no wait-time field, because the
scheduler cannot back one.

### Fairness

The scheduling algorithm, its cost assumptions and its starvation bound are owned by
the admission module and documented in this section when it lands. Its constraints are
fixed now: limits apply at principal and Crew scope on every entry point; queues are
bounded per principal; the scheduler is fair across eligible principals and keeps
order within a session; a queued prompt never becomes a steering command; unknown
callers share one bounded bucket; automation charges its `Principal.system` owner. The
existing lane scheduler in `subagent_manager.admission` is the mechanism to extend,
not replace.

## 5. Collaboration

Presence (`collab.PresenceEntry`) is telemetry. It is bound to the connection's
verified actor, folds every tab of one principal into one entry, expires after
`PRESENCE_TTL_SECONDS` without a refresh, is rate-limited to one activity frame per
`ACTIVITY_MIN_INTERVAL_SECONDS` per connection, and is never persisted. It never
grants access or frees a slot. Draft text is never sent.

A shared decision (`collab.SharedDecision`) is a tool approval or agent question that
every collaborator sees and any one may answer. `classify_response` decides a response
under the resolver's lock: the first response to see `pending` wins, a retry with the
winning `response_id` replays the same outcome, and any other response receives the
resolved decision with `already_resolved`. A resolved decision always names its
responder.

## 6. Wire shapes

### HTTP

| Route | Answer |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/shared-crew/capabilities` | `Capabilities` |
| `GET /api/auth/me` | gains `principal` (`Principal.to_public_dict`) |
| `GET /api/shared-crew/sessions?creator=&q=&cursor=&limit=` | `SessionPage`; each item carries `attribution` |
| `GET /api/shared-crew/people` | observed collaborators with usage, and the directory state |
| `GET /api/shared-crew/capacity` | `CapacityResponse` for the viewer |
| `GET /api/shared-crew/work?session_key=` | public `AcceptedWork` list |
| `POST /api/shared-crew/work/{work_id}/cancel` `{expected_revision}` | the next `AcceptedWork`, or 409 with `current` |
| a chat send | 200 when admitted, 202 with `work` when queued, 429 / 413 / 503 with `error_body` |
| an approval or answer, with `response_id` | the `SharedDecision`; 409 `already_resolved` with it on a lost race |

Browser-bound principals use `to_public_dict` (no issuer or subject); browser-bound
work uses `AcceptedWork.to_public_dict` (no idempotency scope, lease or fencing ids).

### Session list filter

`SessionQuery.from_query` parses `creator` (`all`, `mine`, `unknown` or a principal
id), `q`, an opaque `cursor` and `limit` (clamped to `SESSION_PAGE_MAX`). The filter
runs on the server before pagination. `mine` resolves against the authenticated
viewer, and never matches for an Unknown viewer. The filter is discovery, not access
control. `SessionPage.total_matching` counts every session the filter passes across
all pages; `hidden_by_filter` counts the sessions it excluded.

### WebSocket

The server pushes whole-value frames: `shared_crew.presence`, `shared_crew.work`,
`shared_crew.decision` and `shared_crew.capacity` (`collab.SERVER_FRAMES`). The
client sends `shared_crew.activity` with a session and an `Activity`. The frame
carries no principal; the server stamps the connection's actor and ignores anything
else. On reconnect the client refetches the HTTP state and treats the next frames as
authoritative. It never resubmits a send on its own.

## 7. UI states

| `OperationState` | Shown as | Draft |
|---|---|---|
| `submitted` | sending | kept |
| `queued` | queued, with personal or Crew-wide limit named | sent |
| `admitted`, `running` | running | sent |
| `cancelling` | cancelling | sent |
| `reconciling` | checking | sent |
| `completed` | done | cleared |
| `rejected` | refused, with the reason and next step | restored |
| `failed`, `expired`, `cancelled`, `unknown_outcome` | ended, with the reason | sent |

## 8. Capabilities

`Capabilities` reports what this Crew can back. Every field defaults to
`unavailable`, so a build that wires nothing claims nothing. `containment_level`
states the effective guarantee (`hard`, `best_effort`, `none`), never the configured
intent. `membership_link` is an id from the closed `MEMBERSHIP_LINKS` set, never a
URL taken from config or a peer. Enterprise providers compose through the platform
seams in `kiro_crew.platform` and stay disabled in the public build.

## 9. Records and migration

Every record carries `schema_version` (`codec.SCHEMA_VERSION`). It is the Shared Crew
record version, unrelated to the platform `CONTRACT_VERSION`. Rules:

- An added optional field keeps the version. A changed meaning bumps it, and the
  reader handles every older version.
- A reader preserves keys it does not own (`codec.split_extra` into `extra`, written
  back by `merge_extra`), so an older gateway's rewrite never drops a newer field.
  Session metadata also passes through `history.carry_unowned_metadata`.
- An enum value a newer writer added reads as the field's explicit fallback
  (`enum_or`), not as a refusal of the whole record.
- No migration rewrites history to add attribution. Legacy stays legacy.

The contracts are pinned by `test/test_shared_crew_contracts.py`. Changing a field,
an enum value or a transition changes that test and the TypeScript mirror together.
